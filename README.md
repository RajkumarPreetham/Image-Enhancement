# Image-Enhancement and Noise removal

Enhancing a human brain intersection image (brain.jpg, 515x512, 8 bits/pixel) whose details are not clear. Use the following contrast manipulation algorithms to get a good image.

a)	Linear scaling on full dynamic range, i.e., from 0 to 255.
b)	Power transformations to modify the image.
c)  Use histogram equalization method to enhance image and plot histogram of output image.

Analysis of the specified techniques using histogram plots.

Removing noise from an old picture (ross.jpg, 515x512, 8 bits/pixel) which has been degraded over time. Both uniform and impulse noises are present and the edges of the image are blurred. Reporting each step of your processing, its rationale and show the output image after each step.
